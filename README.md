To get this wonderful project to compile in Visual Studio Community will be a bit finnicky as the file structure is all messed up. 
My old SSD got corrupted midway between Part 2 and 3's submissions. I only realised the folder would be an issue when I initially uploaded it to GitHub. Please be patient! And follow Closely!!

## Here are the steps
-  Make sure your Visual Studio Community is up to date.
-  Click on the Green 'Code Button' on the repository.
-  Select 'HTTPS' and copy the link ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5635d29-1173-4582-a0d0-7e757f95bb9e)
-  Now Open Visual Studio Community.
-  Click on 'Clone a Repository'. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7950bf1-c40e-4a5e-be19-c5d263568837)

-  Paste in the link. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4550b1e-0691-4b78-8b6c-0999939824ce)

## **There will be an issue with the configuration so follow these next steps closely!**
-  Click Clone and wait.
-  In the Solution Explorer you will be presented with this: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54da7e83-96f3-48b0-8ce8-972fb9b0e044)
# ***MAKE SURE TO DOUBLE CLICK ON THE GREEN ONE [MunicipalServicesApp.sln (MunicipalServicesApp.sln)]***
- ***DO NOT SELECT THE ORANGE (NESTED) ONE [MunicipalServicesApp.sln (MunicipalServicesApp\MunicipalServicesApp.sln)]***
-  Once its loaded, go Ahead and click start and have fun!
- **NB: You can also navigate to the bin folder and running the app itself without Visual Studio by going to [WhereThisIsSaved\PROG7312-Final-Submission-D-Blake-Marais-2\MunicipalServicesApp\bin] and double clicking the 'Municipal Services App' .exe**
